        <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The Great Wall of China, a global tourist hotspot, is known across the world for its uniqueness, great length, and historical value. It is also considered to be one of the seven wonders of the world. The Great Wall of China is associated with thousands of years of Chinese history. A series of walls were initially built by Chinese empires and states over a period of many years, beginning as early as the 7th century BCE. Over 20 dynasties/states contributed to the building of the wall. These walls were then joined together to result in the Great Wall of China. It was not just a wall but a kind of fortification with watchtowers, beacon towers, trenches, etc., built at intervals as protection from enemy forces. The official length of the Great Wall of China is 21,196.18 km (13,170.7 mi). However, nearly one-third of the Great Wall has disappeared over time. UNESCO inscribed the site as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.</p>
